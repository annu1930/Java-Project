# Simple Calculator Project

## Overview
This project is a simple GUI-based calculator built using Java Swing. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and handles operator precedence for chained calculations. The calculator provides a clean interface that mimics the basic functionality of a standard physical calculator.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Operator Precedence**: Handles multiple operations in the correct mathematical order.
- **Clear Functionality**: Clear the current calculation and start fresh.
- **Sign Toggle**: Switch the sign of the current number (positive/negative).
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate percentages easily with a dedicated button.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core language used to build the application.
- **Swing**: Java's GUI widget toolkit used to create the interface.
